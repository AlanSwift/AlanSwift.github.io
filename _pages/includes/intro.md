I am a Ph.D. student of Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Siliang Tang and Prof. Yueting Zhuang. I obtained my B.S. degree at Zhejiang University. I also collaborate with [Xu Tan (谭旭)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xuta/) from Microsoft Research Asia and [Lingfei Wu (吴凌飞)](https://sites.google.com/a/email.wm.edu/teddy-lfwu/) from Pinterest closely.

My research interest includes Text-to-Speech Synthesis, ASR Error Correction, Graph Neural Network and Neural Machine Translation. I have published 10 papers includes NeurIPS, EMNLP, IJCAI, et.al.

I have developed the first large-scale non-autoregressive text-to-Speech synthesis system [NaturalSpeech 2](https://speechresearch.github.io/naturalspeech2/).

I am the main contributor of [Graph4NLP project](https://github.com/graph4ai/graph4nlp). I am one of the book chapter contributors of the book "Graph Neural Networks: Foundations, Frontiers, and Applications". 

I am expected to graduate in June 2024 and seeking job opportunities. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:shenkai200861@gmail.com) if you are interested!
